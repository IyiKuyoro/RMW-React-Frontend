This is a front-end application for a carpooling service that enables people to find other individuals traveling in the same direction. It is a rebuild of the [original application](https://github.com/IyiKuyoro/Ride-My-Way-Frontend) with the React library.

The original project was built as a bootcamp project for the author's application to [Andela Nigeria](www.andela.com). This version is a project towards the completion of the author's first training phase at [Andela Nigeria](www.andela.com).

## Getting Started
You can visit the staged application [here](https://rmw-frontend.herokuapp.com/).

You can also obtain a copy to make changes locally by doing the following:
1. Clone the repository
2. Checkout to the `develop` branch
3. On a terminal, run `npm run dev` to start a developement server

## Built With
The application was built with the following:
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/): The front-end library used in building this application
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/): Used to manage the state of the application.
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/): Used to bundle files.
